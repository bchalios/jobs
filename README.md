#Python Jobs

Jobs is a (under constant development) Python API for submitting jobs to SLURM and LSF
batch schedulers.

It tries to abstract away batch scheduler-specific setup for submitting jobs on a cluster,
i.e. you should be able to use the same script to submit a job, regardless the underlying
scheduler.
